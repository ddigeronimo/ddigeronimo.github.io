# My personal website
Online at [dyl.is](https://dyl.is), hosted through GitHub pages.

## Why so Minimal?
I'm pretty passionate about keeping this site minimal to improve readability, accessibility, and load time over slower connections.
With the rise of heavy frontend frameworks and the ever-increasing resource consumption of modern browsers, web bloat is a real problem.
Many websites might seem wonderful if you have a powerful computer, a strong internet connection, and are visually unimpaired, but when those things aren't true, they stop being accessible.
Combating that bloat is an important thing for developers like me to do.

As measured through my browser's network console, the whole page measures in at a little under 4KB total, with a < 100ms load time (frequently under 50ms on my mediocre Wi-Fi).
To that end, there's no Javascript and minimal CSS.

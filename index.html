    <h1>Hi, I'm Dylan! üë®‚Äçüíª</h1>
    <p>I work at <a href="https://www.scholastic.com/home/">Scholastic</a> as an Associate Software Engineer on the <a href="https://classroommagazines.scholastic.com">Classroom Magazines</a> team. Education is something I'm passionate about, and I'm very happy to work on software that improves the experiences of students and educators alike.</p>
    <p>Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.db.com/company/index.htm">Deutsche Bank</a> as a Technology Analyst Intern and at the <a href="https://healthailab.org">Health and AI Lab</a> as an Undergraduate Research Assistant.</p>
    <p>I received my B.S. in Computer Science with Honor from Stevens Institute of Technology.</p>
    <p>I'm experienced with Java, Python, JavaScript, and many other languages and technologies. In my spare time, I'm learning Rust and Scala.</p>
    <p>For more information about my skills and experience, you can check out my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a> or my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylan-digeronimo-269109140/"> Linkedin profile</a>.</p>

    <p>Take a look at some of the work on my <a href="https://github.com/ddigeronimo">Github</a> or <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/ddigeronimo">HackerRank</a> profiles.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://ebookfoundation.org">Free Ebook Foundation</a> is a great organization. In my senior year, I was part of a team of Stevens students who collaborated with the foundation on <a href="https://cce.ebookfoundation.org">a search interface allowing access to thousands of copyright records</a> as our senior capstone project.</p>
    <p><a href="https://wcpr.org">WCPR</a> is another organization I'm proud to have been a part of, where I served as General Manager, Programming Manager, and Sysadmin and hosted a radio show.</p>
    <p>If you're a fellow music lover, check out some of my playlists on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/dylan_digeronimo">Spotify</a>. I also make music (more on that soon).</p>

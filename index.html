    <h2>Let me tell you about myself.</h2>
    <p>I received my B.S. in Computer Science with Honor from Stevens Institute of Technology.</p>
    <p>Starting in July 2020, I will be working at <a href="https://www.scholastic.com/home/">Scholastic</a> as an Associate Software Engineer on the Classroom Magazines team. Education is something I'm passionate about, and I'm very happy to work on software that improves the experiences of students and educators.</p>
    <p>Previously, I've worked at <a href="https://www.db.com/company/index.htm">Deutsche Bank</a> as a Technology Analyst Intern and at the <a href="https://healthailab.org">Health and AI Lab</a> as an Undergraduate Research Assistant.</p>
    <p>I'm proficient with Java, Python, JavaScript, and many other languages and technologies.</p>
    <p>For more information about my skills and experience, you can check out my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a> or my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylan-digeronimo-269109140/"> Linkedin profile</a>.</p>
